    "Let's quickly get the definitions out of the way, and start:\n",
    "* **Vector**: a sequence of numbers; very much like a `list` in regular Python: [1, 2, 6, -2, 0].\n",
    "* **Matrix**: a 2-dimensional structure of numbers; a vector is therefore a matrix, where one of the dimensions is equal to 1. You could crudely store a matrix in regular Python using a list of lists, where the main list contains entries which themselves are lists. But while this could store your data, it would not be great for calculations, such as matrix multiplication.\n",
    "* **Array**: an n-dimensional structure of numbers; a general form of a matrix, but with multiple dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a 3-dimensional array here shows data collected in a lab: we are performing the experiment several times (N), in each experiment we have several sensors (K), and we set the sensors to collect data on a regular interval so that we end up with J samples per experiment, per sensor.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/batch-data-layers-into-page-3d-structure.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "Storing the data like this is useful, because now you could perform calculations on all experiments over all time, for all sensors in array X.\n",
    "\n",
    "*For example:* you can calculate the average in the direction of arrow $J$, to reduce the *array* to a *matrix*. That matrix would be the average value of the sensor for the experiments. That reduced matrix would have $N$ rows and $K$ columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineering applications benefit from using *vectors*, or *matrices* or *arrays*: they are sequences of data all of the _same type_. Arrays behave a lot like lists in Python, except for the constraint that all elements have the same type. \n",
