    "### Five main goals with data science\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 major goals when dealing with data from systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learning more about our system\n",
    "1. Troubleshooting a problem that is occurring\n",
    "1. Making predictions using (some) data from the system\n",
    "1. Monitoring that system in real-time, or nearly real time \n",
    "1. Optimizing the system\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals 1 and 2 take place off-line, using data that has been collected already.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals 3, making predictions from the system (e.g. predicting how far away it is from completing, or what quality is being produced from the system), is typically required to support other decisions, or to apply real-time control on the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Goal 4 also can take place on-line, and is used to ensure the system is operating in a stable manner, and if not, using the data to figure what is going wrong, or about to go wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal 5 is typically off-line, and here we use the data to make longer term improvements. For example, we try to move the system to a different state of operation that is more optimal/profitable. This can also be done in real-time, where systems are continuously shifted around to track an optimum target.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one way to to categorize data science problems. There are of-course other ways to consider it: such as if you are dealing with one variable (vector) or many variables (matrices). Or which type of technique you are using: supervised or unsupervised.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will encounter these terms along the way. But for now, you should be able to see any problem where you have used data as fitting into 1 of these 5 categories above. Try it!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Framing your objective\n",
    "\n",
    "We can look at any data science project and find that it is aligned to one, or more, of these major goals, or also known as 'application domains'.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learning more about our system\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Troubleshooting a problem that is occurring\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Making predictions using (some) data from the system\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Monitoring that system in real-time, or nearly real time \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Optimizing the system\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can find our specific objective in one, or more of these 5 goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: your manager asks you to use data (whatever is available) to discover why we are seeing increased returns of our most profitable product.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your objective: Find reason(s) for increased returns of product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: That is what this part of the course is about. You will learn about the tools to do visualize the data, and reach your objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which of the 5 goals above are used?: Number 2 \"Troubleshoot a problem that is occurring\" is the most direct. But along the way to achieving that goal, you will almost certainly apply number 1: \"Learn more about your system\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Following up: in the future, after you have found the reasons for returned product, you might have done number 5: \"optimizing the system\" to prevent less bad quality production. Then, in a different data science project, based on number 4: you \"monitor the system in real-time\" to prevent producing bad quality products.\"  This might be done by applying number 3: \"making predictions of the product quality\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, these 5 goals are generally very broad. Why do we mention them?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might learn, in other courses and later in your career, about different tools to implement. Then you can interchange the tools in your toolbox. For example, linear regression is one type of prediction tool, but so is a neural network. If one tool does not work so well, you can swap it for another one in your pipeline."
