    "* The text can sometimes be added *inside the bar* if there is restricted space.\n",
    "* An interesting characteristic of a bar plot is that **the *interpretation* of a bar plot does not differ if the category axis is reordered.** It can be easier to interpret the plot with a particular ordering; however, the interpretation won't be *different* if using a different ordering. The example below demonstrates this: the interpretation has not changed, but the visualization is far more effective.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> The bar plot is a univariate plot on a two-dimensional axis. The axes are not called x- or y-axes. Instead, one axis is called the ***category axis*** showing the category name, while the other, the ***value axis***, shows the value of each category as a bar.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Enrichment\n",
    "\n",
    "Bar plots are notorious for their use of excessive 'ink': using many pixels to show a small amount of 'data'. We should aim to maximize the data:ink ratio, which means high amount of data represented with as few pixels as possible. Bar plots do not do that. \n",

    "The categories used in a barplot can often be rearranged without 'breaking' the message.  We saw an example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "This happened because each bar is independent of the others. If you re-order them, the information shown -- from the height of the bars, on the value axis -- is still the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not mean you should show the bar plot in a random order. By ordering the information you make the plot easier to read, and in an underhanded way you subtly alter how the user reads the message. You can use this power to your advantage to make the message clearer, but you can also use it to frustrate your reader. Rather do the former, and not the latter."
