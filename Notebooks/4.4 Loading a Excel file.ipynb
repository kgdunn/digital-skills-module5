    "* The Excel file format, thought publically specified, is controlled by a corporation. Though unlikely, files from 10 years ago might not easily be readily in 30 years from now. Compare this to flat text files, which have always, and almost certainly be readable in the future. Point being: do not rely Excel files for long-time archives.\n",
    "* Excel files do not just contain data: they may contain all sorts of formatting (e.g. cell borders, headers, colours, graphs), which are not imported into Python. What is visually obvious as a heading in an opened Excel file is not necessarily so when reading the file into Python.\n",
    "* Reading and processing an Excel file might cost you the price of software license. In practice, most Excel files can fully and functionally be opened by some [alternative software](https://www.google.nl/search?q=alternative+to+Excel).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "* The data in an Excel file can be graphically manipulated. Completely removing a column from a spreadsheet is no problem, for example.\n",
    "* Additional calculations can be added to the spreadsheet, and then read into Python for further processing.\n",
