    "First, a word on importing libraries to expand your running Python session. Because libraries are large collections of code and are for special purposes, they are not loaded automatically when you launch Python (or IPython, or Jupyter). You have to import a library using the `import` command. For example, to import **NumPy**, you can enter:\n",

    "import numpy\n",

It is arguably better that you are explicit, but practicality and code reuse often dictates that people write it with ``np`` instead."
