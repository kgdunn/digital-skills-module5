    "First, a word on importing libraries to expand your running Python session. Because libraries are large collections of code and are for special purposes, they are not loaded automatically when you launch Python (or IPython, or Jupyter). You have to import a library using the `import` command. For example, to import **NumPy**, you can enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you execute that command in a code cell, you can call any NumPy function using the dot notation, prepending the library name. For example, some commonly used functions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [`numpy.linspace()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html)\n",
    "* [`numpy.ones()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ones.html#numpy.ones)\n",
    "* [`numpy.zeros()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.zeros.html#numpy.zeros)\n",
    "* [`numpy.empty()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.empty.html#numpy.empty)\n",

    "Part of the community effort to creating the NumPy library, is also an effort at good documentation. Click and read one of those links to explore the documentation - the pages each have the same layout, so once you know where to look, you can quickly search and refer to the documentation for other functions.\n",

    "All this does is create an alias for `numpy` with the shorter string `np`, so you then would call a **NumPy** function like this: `np.linspace()`. This is just an alternative way of doing it, for lazy people that find it too long to type `numpy` and want to save 3 characters each time. For the not-lazy, typing `numpy` is more readable and beautiful. \n",
