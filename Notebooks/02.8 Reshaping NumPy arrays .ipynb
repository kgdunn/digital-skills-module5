    "The most common example is when you read your data and it is one long vector. But you know that every 7th entry, for example, is the data from the start of a new week. So entry 1, 7, 14, etc, should be the start of the row, and you would like 7 columns. Once you have it in this form you can calculate weekly averages (across the rows), or daily averages (down each of the 7 columns).\n",

    "An interesting other attribute is the ``my_data.ndim`` attribute, which shows how many dimensions your data has. The number of dimensions will **always** match the number of values in the ``.shape`` tuple.\n",
