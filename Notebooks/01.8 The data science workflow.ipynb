    "# A general work flow for any project where you deal with data\n",
    "\n",
    "After years of experience, and working with data you will find your own approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is my 6-step approach (not linear, but iterative): **Define**, **Get**, **Explore**, **Clean**, **Manipulate**, **Communicate**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define**/clarify the objective. Write down exactly what you need to deliver to have the project/assignment considered as completed.\n",
    "\n",
    " Then your next steps become clear.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Look for and **get** your data (or it will be given to you by a colleague). Since you have your objective clarified, it is clearer now what data, and how much data you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then start looking at the data. Are the data what we expect? This is the **explore** step. Use plots and summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clean** up your data. This step and the prior step are iterative. As you explore your data you notice problems, bad data entry, you ask questions, you gain a bit of insight into the data. You clean, and re-explore, but always with the goal(s) in mind. Or perhaps you realize already this isn't the right data to reach your objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Modifying, making calculations from, and **manipulate** the data. This step is also called modeling, if you are building models, but sometimes you are simply summarizing your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. From the data models and summaries and plots you start extracting the insights and conclusions you were looking for. Again, you can go back to any of the prior steps if you realize you need that to better achieve your goal(s). You **communicate** clear visualizations to your colleagues, with crisp, short explanations that meet the objectives.\n",
