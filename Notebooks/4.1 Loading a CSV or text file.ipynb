    "2. Open the file in a text editor. ([NotePad++ is recommended on Windows](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or use your built-in text editor on Mac/Linux/other operating systems.\n",

    "### How is a CSV file processed by Python?\n",
    "* When the file is imported, it is read from top to bottom, line-by-line.\n",
    "* Within each line we will read from left-to-right. Every time a comma is encountered, the importer will assume it is the start of a new column, and place the following number into that column.\n",
    "* It continues until it reachs the end of the line of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Terminology:** the comma symbol is used to separate one number from the next. In this case, the comman is also known as a *delimiter*. You can imagine that you can devise a file format where you specify some other symbol as the delimiter, for example the 'tab' character, or the semi-colon. \n",

    "### Problems and pitfalls\n",
    "* The comma indicator which is often used in European countries for decimals, as in \"72,6\" for the number 72.6 will be problematic. Since importing reads from left to right \"72,6\" will create an integer of 72 in one column, and a value of 6 in the next column. \n",
    "* CSV files must therefore be created using a period (or full-stop) as the decimal separator for floating point numbers (i.e. non-integer numbers).\n",
    "* The CSV format is not economical for large datasets. \n",
    "* It should be clear from the above description that it is not certain how many rows or columns will be encountered before loading a CSV file.\n",
    "* Using text headings for either the columns [called column headers] or for the rows [called row headers] can lead to confusion. You will see how we can handle this below: we skip them.\n",
    "* Editing data in a CSV file is not simple: you cannot easily delete an entire column, for example. Manipulating data, such as calculate an average of a column, is also not possible. Contrast this to Excel files, described elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "* The CSV format is future-proof: since everything inside is just a plain-old text file, it will always be openable, no matter which software you use in the future.\n",
    "* You can quickly change the CSV file to update/add/remove parts of it using your text editor. No special software is required.\n",
    "* We can handle missing data: put a ``NaN`` between two commas. For example: `` 71,NaN,73 `` indicates a value is missing between the ``71`` and the ``73``.\n",
    "* The CSV file is a good data-interchange format. By that we mean: most data manipulation software can export to CSV, and once you have that as an intermediate file, you can re-import it into other software, including Python. Use it, for example, to export a database to CSV.\n",
    "* Because of its simplicity, it widely supported in most data manipulation software. But its simplicity is also its downfall for more complex data (e.g. data greater than 2-dimensions, such as digital images). \n",
